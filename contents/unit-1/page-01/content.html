        <p class="section-content"> Microsoft made probably its biggest changes to formulas with the new version by introducing Dynamic Array
            Formulas. This differs from the legacy array formulas in which you needed to use the ‘Ctrl+Shift+Enter’
            (CSE) keys to enter an array formula. In addition to not needing to press CSR, other main upshots to this
            upgrade are the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You only need to enter the array formula in one cell rather than enter- ing the formula in many
                    different cells as required by the individual formulas. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The size of the array is automatically resized based upon data added or removed as well as the
                    parameter changes within the formula. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Any dynamic array formulas that return values into more than one cell will automatically ‘spill’,
                    meaning results of the array will automati- cally populate based upon the parameters of the formula
                    and the data entered. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you need to change a formula in the old CSR array formula, you will need to edit the entire range
                    simultaneously. With the new dynamic array formulas, all you need to do is modify the original cell
                    in which the formula resides. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="section-content">The examples in this chapter will make the above features clearer as we traverse through them. </p>
        <p class="section-content">Essentially the main difference is that you no longer need to use the ‘Ctrl+Shift+Enter’ when entering a
            formula; rather, simply enter the formula. </p>
